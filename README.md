A game originally made to challenge myself to see what I could do in an hour. It was my most productive hour ever.

During that hour I made the basic concept of the game, there was score and increasing difficulty. Throughout the next two days I refactored bits of the code, added a couple of extra features, namely different weapons, and left it out of boredom.

Controls:
* Mouse - Aim
* LMB - Primary Fire
* RMB - Secondary Fire
* x - Special (rocket launcher on some)
* Mouse scroll - Weapon selection
* w - Place wall at mouse
* F3 - Toggle debug
* F4 - Toggle pause

Walls are very glitchy and somewhat OP, they're free and will stop enemies, in which case they have to destroy them to get through. This was the last feature added hence it's pretty bad.

Sounds are glitchy and walls are awful. If errors about VC++ redist, needs VC++2012 or 2013.
Made around October 2013.
